    <!-- Abstract -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems.
            Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

    <!-- Methodology -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            We introduce a paradigm shift in agent architecture design, i.e., HTAM. This framework departs from social analogies and instead derives its structure directly from the logical dependencies inherent to the problem domain.
        </p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/figure1.png" alt="Methodology Comparison">
            <p class="image-caption">
                Comparative analysis of agent architectures on a complex geospatial query. (1) ReAct's iterative, step-by-step process lacks a global strategy, leading to chaotic, redundant tool calls and incomplete solutions. (2) Plan&Execute adheres to a rigid, pre-determined plan, showing no capacity for correction even when encountering errors, ultimately failing the task. (3) HTAM demonstrates a structured, hierarchical decomposition, ensuring a logical progression from data acquisition (Layer 1) to analysis (Layer 2) and final synthesis (Layer 3), leading to a coherent and complete solution.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            To validate the efficacy and practicality of the HTAM model, we developed EarthAgent, a multi-agent system that serves as its implementation for the remote sensing domain.

    <!-- GeoPlan-bench -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>GeoPlan-bench</h2>
        <p>
            We introduce GeoPlan-bench. Its design is built around complex and long-planning remote sensing tasks, where queries require agents to perform strategic decomposition, tool selection, and dependency management without explicit guidance. We develop a semi-automated pipeline for task construction. The process is divided into two stages: task generation and task validation. In addition, we design a suite of metrics designed to assess the quality of an agent's generated plan from three perspectives: correctness, structure, and holistic completeness.
